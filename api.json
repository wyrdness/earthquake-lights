      "full": "Earthquake lights (EQL), also known as earthquake luminescence or seismic lights, are unusual luminous phenomena that appear in the sky or near the ground before, during, or after seismic activity. These mysterious lights have been reported for centuries across earthquake-prone regions worldwide, manifesting in various forms including glowing orbs, sheet lightning, flame-like columns, and aurora-like displays. While historically dismissed as folklore or misidentified conventional phenomena, recent scientific research has confirmed their reality and proposed several mechanisms involving piezoelectric effects, release of charged particles, and electromagnetic disturbances in the Earth's crust. The phenomenon gained scientific credibility in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as photographic and video evidence accumulated, and as theoretical frameworks from plasma physics, materials science, and geophysics provided plausible explanations. Earthquake lights represent a fascinating intersection of seismology, atmospheric physics, and electromagnetic phenomena, offering potential applications in earthquake prediction and early warning systems."
